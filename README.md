# Google Maps
An idea for enhancing Google Maps is to alert users about **saved places** along their current route.


**🗺️ Smart Wish List Route Alerts for Google Maps (Concept Proposal)**

**🧠 Idea Summary**

**A context-aware notification feature for Google Maps that alerts users when they are navigating near a saved location from their “Want to Go,” “Favorites,” or other saved lists.**

**🚀 Introduction or 📍 Use Case**
Have you ever saved dozens of interesting places in your Google Maps — “Want to Go,” “Starred,” or “Favorites” — but completely forgotten about them while passing right by? You're not alone.
In a world where we're constantly bookmarking destinations, the lack of timely reminders about those spots makes our saved lists less useful than they could be.
While a user is navigating, if their route passes within a specified radius (e.g., 1–3 km) of a saved location, the system displays a prompt:
“You’re passing near [Place Name] — would you like to visit it?”
For example:
Imagine you're driving to a friend's place across town. Unknown to you, you're passing just 500 meters away from the museum you saved six months ago. With this feature, you'd get a non-intrusive prompt:

**🔧 Core Components**
Access to user’s saved locations via Maps API
Real-time route tracking
Radius-based matching engine
UI/UX prompts for suggestions and detours

**🚀 Benefits**
My proposed solution is simple but impactful:
While a user is navigating a route on Google Maps, the system checks if any of their saved locations (e.g. “Want to Go,” “Favorites,” “Starred Places”) lie within a specified distance from their current travel path — and notifies them with a suggestion.
Surfaces long-forgotten saved places at relevant moments.

Increases user engagement with personal lists
Turns routine travel into discovery opportunities

🛠️ **Possible Implementation Tools**
Google Maps SDK (Android/iOS)
Google Places API
Background location services
Firebase Cloud Messaging (for smart prompts)

**🔒 Privacy Considerations**
All saved location scanning is local
No 3rd-party data scraping
User control over prompt frequency and list sources
